Manifesto of the Freeborn Man: A Call to Truth and Freedom.
a call to the system to be honest, a promise to humanity not to be silent, a testimony of my faith in the Almighty, who is to me at all times
Leading and protecting.


The Truth: Inevitable

Everything has a reason - no coincidence, only.
Divine will.
My question is clear, my position unwavering, my energy unstoppable.
The system can be silent, run, attack - but the truth.
remains.
I am not a citizen, not a slave, not a pawn in their game.
I am a man born free, a child of God, and I will continue until they acknowledge what they already know: their bondage has no ground, their power has no right.
This is the beginning of the end and with the Almighty at my side, nothing is too great,
No one too strong, no matrix too fixed.


I call for recognition.
I call for freedom.
I call for truth.

For me,
for my child,
for all of us.

the "system" put me in the dark, not realizing I was a seed üòè
